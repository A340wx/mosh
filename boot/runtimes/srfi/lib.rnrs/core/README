;;; This file builds r6rs up using a sequence of libraries.
;;; It constitutes a nontrivial example, tutorial and test
;;; of the library system.  
;;;
;;; It is meant to be expanded by expander.scm and compiled 
;;; together with the latter before using in a production system.
;;;
;;; Various of the standard macros were copied from
;;; SRFI-93 reference implementation.
;;;
;;; An explicit renaming library is included for easier 
;;; porting of legacy macros in some implementations.
