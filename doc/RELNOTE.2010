About This Release
------------------

Maintenace release.
Starting from this release, Visual Studio builds are migrated to CMake.
See doc/README.CMake for details.

New build prerequisites:

    - oniguruma >= 5.9.0
    - CMake >= 2.8.0 (Windows, Visual Studio only)

    Oniguruma library is unbundled from mosh distribution. Configure script will
    search oniguruma with following order; 1) using `onig-config' 2) using
    -lonig gcc option and user specified CFLAGS 3) if oniguruma source
    distribution is found in a subdir as named `onig' it will be build together.

Changes:

    New platform support includes FFI support:
        - Darwin x86_64
        - FreeBSD amd64

    New platform support WITHOUT FFI support:
        - Windows amd64 (Experimental)

    New build environment support:
        - Visual Studio 2010 i386/amd64 (using CMake, experimental)
        - XCode 3.x amd64 (using CMake, experimental)

    Now mosh REPL handles multiple-values like Gauche. When a procedure return
    multiple values, REPL will show each values unlike previous version (which
    discarded values other than the first.)

    FreeBSD:
        Use sysctl(3) to implement (mosh-executable-path) instead of procfs.

Bug fixes:

    (rnrs):
        exact-non-negative-integer? had retuned incorrect value.
        Fixed expt procedure bug reported by Eduardo Cavazos.
        Fixed Issue 147 reported by mrc.mgg: 
            log procedure had returned incorrect value.
        Fixed Issue 148 reported by mrc.mgg: 
            expt procedure is now much more faster than previous release.
            Now it uses GMP mpz_pow_ui when operands are fixnums.
        Fixed Issue 149 reported by mrc.mgg: 
            Reader now handles the "."(period) charactor collectly.
        Fixed Issue 154 reported by tabe.fixedpoint: 
            exact-integer-sqrt procedure now raises error when an inexact 
            integer given.
        Fixed Issue 159:
            assoc procedure now checks argments are list of pairs.
            (assoc '(0)) no longer causes SEGV.
        Fixed Issue 161 reported by tabe.fixedpoint:
            -(minus) procedure was returned 0 instead of raising an error when
            applied with 0 argument. Now (-) raises an &assertion error.
        Fixed Issue 169 reported by ianprice90:
            Reading 0 elements from a port was resulting in an eof-object.
        Fixed Issue 170 reported by ianprice90:
            Custom binary/text port's close procedure was not called.
        Fixed Issue 173 reported by ianprice90:
            string->number was returned an EOF object on empty string.

    (mosh memcached):
        memcached-set! procedure now collectly sends flags and expiry 
        arguments.

    (srfi :98):
        get-environment-variable and get-environment-variables had returned
        incollect results at MinGW/Cygwin environment.

    Core:
        Fixed shebang handling bug reported by Eduardo Cavazos.
        Fixed Issue 158: 
            nmosh was not started when $HOME is not set or has wrong value.
        Fixed Issue 175 reported by marcomaggi:
            C procedures (DeclareProcedureName macro) was not set returning 
            values count properly. 
        
    Documentation:
        Fixed Issue 167 reported by amoebae:
            (mosh ffi) example was incorrect.

Known issues:

    See http://code.google.com/p/mosh-scheme/issues/list for full list.

    - configure script will complain about
        configure: WARNING: no configuration information is in libatomic_ops
    - #t.BLAHBLAH... read as #t instead of raising error.

    Win32/64 Host:
        - Win64 host support is experimental and lacks FFI support.
        - "make check" or "make test" tests are not work properly.
        - Visual Studio builds are suboptimal for performance due to absense 
          of char32 support and the "computed goto"(used for direct-threading
          feature.)
        - Visual Studio 2008 SP1 sometimes won't finish their compilation
          when both link-time code generation(/LTCG) and /Ox are enabled.
        - mosh/nmosh cannot build using MinGW64.

    MacOS X Host:
        - mosh/nmosh cannot build as an universal binary.
        - Direct-threading is disabled on XCode builds. This will reduce
          runtime performance. Use ./configure builds for performance.
        

Mosh 0.2.5 Release Note

About This Release
------------------

This release introduces "nmosh" another R6RS environment.
See doc/README.nmosh for details.

Changes

    Introduce nmosh by OKUMURA Yuki.
     nmosh is a port of Andre van Tonder's R6RS macro and runtime[1] and R6RS
    record from Larceny[2] with additional expander-cache (ACC) and debugging 
    feature such as runtime stack trace. 
     Although nmosh is intended to a drop-in replacement of previous psyntax
    based mosh, it is still lacks some mosh specific enhancements against R6RS
    standard such as SRFI-38, shared namespace with expand/run phases and more.
     In this version, standard build process(./configure && make) and MSVC
    solution build both binary which "mosh" is for previous psyntax based 
    runtime and "nmosh" is for nmosh runtime.
    [1] http://www.het.brown.edu/people/andre/macros/
    [2] http://www.larcenists.org/
    
    Configure script now supports out-of-tree building. 
     Since some GTEST based tests still not support out-of-tree building and 
    testing, "make check" target will fail (in out-of-tree build only, in-tree
    builds should pass it.)

    updated library
          (irregex) : 0.8.1 (Alex Shinn's irregex library)
     (mosh process) : add "exec"

    new library
          (shorten) : the shorten formed lambda like Gauche
                      (^a (+ 1 a)) == (lambda (a) (+ 1 a)) etc.
        (rnrs load) : ERR5RS load (nmosh only)

    BoehmGC: MIPS32 processor support.

    MSVC build now depends on MPIR instead of GMP.
     Download MPIR from http://www.mpir.org and extract to win/mpir. mosh.sln
    will load and build them together.
     Note that building MPIR will require yasm installed. see
    MPIR's own document (mpir/build.vc9/readme.txt) for detail.

Bug fixes.

    Fixed Issue 141 reported by mrc.mgg: 
        Profiler(-p) no longer causes sporadic SEGVs while startup.
    Fixed Issue 140 reported by mrc.mgg: 
        R6RS write now uses normal write procedure instead of SRFI-38 printer introduced 
        in 0.2.4.
    Fixed Issue 136 reported by Will.Donnelly:
        (mosh process) library now exports exec procedure among its friends.
