mosh on NetBSD
===============

1. Install
----------

NetBSD default system compiler (gcc-4.1) will miscompile mosh when
optimizations were enabled.

- Install following packages:
  lang/gcc44
  devel/gmake
  devel/oniguruma
  devel/gmp
- ./configure CFLAGS=-I/usr/pkg/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/pkg/lib
- gmake
- sudo gmake install

mosh cannot build using BSD "make".

2. Limitations
--------------

- mosh is currently only tested at i386 architecture.
