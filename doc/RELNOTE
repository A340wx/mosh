About This Release
------------------

Mosh will be linked with OpenSSL library when available in Linux/FreeBSD/MacOSX.

FFI API(pointer-ref-* and pointer-set-*! from (mosh ffi)) had changed. See
below for details.

extlib/: Mosh source code now ships with slightly patched oniguruma-5.9.2 
source. This oniguruma will be used in CMake builds and MonaOS. Most users 
can safely ignore this.

nmosh user interface learned colour output. Set NMOSH_CLICOLOR 
environment variable to "enable" to enable this. 

Ruby's ERB like template library (Experimental).

Facebook Graph API library (Experimental).

Changes:

    New platform support:
        MonaOS

    Deprecated platform:
        MinGW32+MSYS using "./configure" -- Use CMake instead.
        VisualStudio 2008

    Psyntax-mosh (mosh):
        "make install" no longer performs cache update in $HOME/.mosh.
        CMake support was dropped.
        Now REPL uses SRFI-38 form to write their output. (See Issue 199)

    nmosh:
        Provides default (nmosh debugger) library which supports colourised
        output.
        Added default library loadpath and embedded-mode suitable for 
        application embedding. See doc/README.nmosh.
        Now REPL uses SRFI-38 form to write their output. (See Issue 199)

        Windows:
            nmosh now saves expand/compile cache(ACC) into 
            %LOCALAPPDATA%/nmosh-cache by default.

    New libraries:
         (templete) : Ruby's ERB like template library (Experimental).
         (facebook) : Facebook Graph API library (Experimental).

    Updated libraries:
      (mosh socket) : SSL/TLS Socket support with OpenSSL.
          (mosh pp) : Implement R6RS char/string escapes.
         (mosh ffi) : pointer-ref-* and pointer-set-*! now take C-like scaled 
                      index. See "bug fixes" section below.

    Updated 3rd party library:
          (irregex) : 0.8.2+ hg fixes (Alex Shinn's irregex library)

    Removed libraries:
        Various redundant libraries were removed. SRFIs no longer have (srfi 1)
        like alias. Note that SRFI-97 aliases (like (srfi :1)) are supported.

Bug fixes:

    psyntax-mosh:
        Various bug-fixes from Ikarus psyntax. See Issue 134.

    Reader:
        Number reader now reads 2.2250738585072012e-308 flawlessly.
            See
http://blog.practical-scheme.net/gauche/20110203-bitten-by-floating-point-numbers-again
            for details.
        Fixed Issue 178 reported by lp:~weinholt: 
            A symbol immediately followed by string was not accepted by reader.
        Fixed Issue 181 reported by mrc.mgg: 
            Number datum with "bar" like 1|53 was not accepted by reader. Note
            that mosh will ignore specified mantissa width.
        Fixed Issue 185 reported by mrc.mgg: 
            SRFI-62 style datum comment was not accepted by reader in certain 
            cases.

    REPL:
        Fixed Issue 199 reported by amoebae:
            Segumentation fault on printing circular object.

    (rnrs base): nmosh version
        Fixed Issue 201 reported by mrc.mgg:
            assert was not return any value.

    (rnrs io simple):
        Fixed Issue 183 and Issue 186 (partially): 
            (display #\tab) had outputted "x9;" instead of a tab character.
            Non-displayable chars still not fixed. See Issue 186.

    (rnrs io ports):
        Fixed Issue 198 reported by amoebae (partially):
            put-string cannot be called during put-string of textual custom 
            output port. 
        Fixed Issue 200 reported by mrc.mgg:
            set-port-position! to the last index is now acceptable.

    (rnrs syntax-case):
        Fixed Issue 195 reported by mrc.mgg:
            psyntax-mosh and nmosh had implemented SRFI-93 version of 
            with-syntax.  A patch for psyntax-mosh was contributed by amoebae.

    (mosh): nmosh version
        library-path procedure was not compatible with psyntax-mosh's one.

    (mosh ffi):
        pointer-ref-* and pointer-set-*! index is now scaled by C sizeof(TYPE).
        i.e.) (pointer-ref-c-pointer ptr num) is now eqv. of ptr[num].
        These indices are erroneously scaled by 1(byte) in prior releases.

    (srfi :1 lists):
        Fixed Issue 192:
            delete-duplicates now accepts (delete-duplicates obj) form.

    (srfi :19 time):
        Fixed Issue 188: 
            SRFI-19 implementation now includes a leap second inserted in 
            2008-2009.

    (srfi :26 cut):
        cut and cute was not work with <...>.

    (srfi :39 parameters):
        Fixed Issue 184: 
            SRFI-39 now implemented with (rnrs) constructs. Former psyntax-mosh
            used psyntax's parameterize which was not compatible with SRFI-39.

    (srfi :42 eager-comprehensions):
        string-ec, vector-of-length-ec and min-ec was not properly exported.

Known Issues:

    See http://code.google.com/p/mosh-scheme/issues/list for full list.

    - Every user's mosh cache (~/.mosh) should be removed when mosh updated.
    - Custom port implementation cannot call port-related procedure recursively.
      See Issue 198.
    - Some C++ compilers are known to miscompile mosh/nmosh. Try CXXFLAGS="-O1"
      if your compiler do not finish compilation.
      - MSVC 2008 x64 - May not finish compilation when LTO enabled.
      - Clang++ trunk - Sometimes miscompile bytevector related procedures.
      - MSVC 2010 SP1 - Sometimes causes compiler's internal error. Repeat
        compilation if this occur.
    - configure script will complain about
        configure: WARNING: no configuration information is in libatomic_ops
