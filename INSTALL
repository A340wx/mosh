INSTALLING MOSH
===============

1. Overview
===========

Mosh supports two way to configure and build interpreter.

1. "configure" build

  As usual, you can use "./configure && make" to build and install Mosh.
  Please refer O/S Specific section below.
  "configure" build supports out-of-tree build, cross-compilation and 
  "make check" for testing.
