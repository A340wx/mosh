This directory includes some library distribution for convenience.

 - bdwgc - Boehm GC
      For: autotools, CMake, MonaOS

      Boehm GC is (currently) only GC for Mosh and is always used.

 - onig-5.9.2 - oniguruma
      For: CMake, MonaOS

      oniguruma is regular expression library.
      This won't used at all in autotools(configure) builds.
      Please install oniguruma development package (like `onigruma-devel`)
      and see if `onig-config` command exists for autotools build.

      slightly patched, see : http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nurse/20100826
